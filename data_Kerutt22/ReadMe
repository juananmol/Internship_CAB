Abstract:
    The hydrogen Lyman{alpha} line is often the only measurable feature in
    optical spectra of high-redshift galaxies. Its shape and strength are
    influenced by radiative transfer processes and the properties of the
    underlying stellar population. High equivalent widths of several
    hundred {AA} are especially hard to explain by models and could point
    towards unusual stellar populations, for example with low
    metallicities, young stellar ages, and a top-heavy initial mass
    function. Other aspects influencing equivalent widths are the
    morphology of the galaxy and its gas properties.

    The aim of this study is to better understand the connection between
    the Lyman{alpha} rest-frame equivalent width (EW0) and spectral
    properties as well as ultraviolet (UV) continuum morphology by
    obtaining reliable EW0 histograms for a statistical sample of galaxies
    and by assessing the fraction of objects with large equivalent widths.

    We used integral field spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic
    Explorer (MUSE) combined with broad-band data from the Hubble Space
    Telescope (HST) to measure EW0 . We analysed the emission lines of
    1920 Lyman{alpha} emitters (LAEs) detected in the full MUSE-Wide (one
    hour exposure time) and MUSE-Deep (ten hour exposure time) surveys and
    found UV continuum counterparts in archival HST data. We fitted the UV
    continuum photometric images using the Galfit software to gain
    morphological information on the rest-UV emission and fitted the
    spectra obtained from MUSE to determine the double peak fraction,
    asymmetry, full-width at half maximum, and flux of the Lyman{alpha}
    line.

    The two surveys show different histograms of Lyman{alpha} EW0 . In
    MUSE-Wide, 20% of objects have EW0>240{AA}, while this fraction is
    only 11% in MUSE-Deep and ~=16% for the full sample. This includes
    objects without HST continuum counterparts (one-third of our sample),
    for which we give lower limits for EW0. The object with the highest
    securely measured EW0 has EW0=589+/-193{AA} (the highest lower limit
    being EW0=4464{AA}). We investigate the connection between EW0 and
    Lyman{alpha} spectral or UV continuum morphological properties.

    The survey depth has to be taken into account when studying EW0
    distributions. We find that in general, high EW0 objects can have a
    wide range of spectral and UV morphological properties, which might
    reflect that the underlying causes for high EW0 values are equally
    varied.

Description:
    The catalogs contains measurements of properties of 1920 LAEs in the
    MUSE-Wide and MUSE-deep fields. The content of the catalog is
    described throughout the paper and in particular in Appendix B.
